# Data Base Analisys Consumption

## Introduction
Database Management Systems (DBMS), specifically Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), are software components that could require a lot of hardware resources for a database with a lot of information, and this possibly could lead to a lot of power consumption at several modules on the servers, as well as on the client side. Currently, there exist studies approaching the energy-efficiency of RDBMS based on prediction
models (Guo et al., 2022), by proposing guidelines to reduce energy waste in terms of improving query planning, processing, and execution (Stavros, 2009; You et al., 2020), or by measuring the energy consumption with tools and benchmarks (Guo et al, 2022). In particular, query optimization strategies is an important aspect in database systems that have been studied only from the perspective of performance improvements in their operations, rather than on the energy costs of their operations. Nevertheless, the goal of the query optimization would move to choosing the best trade-offs between different metrics in order to meet the multi-criteria quality of service that consumers have requested. It is important to look into the potential trade-offs between various metrics and resources, as well as the intricate relationships between these metrics and how they affect query processing as a whole.
